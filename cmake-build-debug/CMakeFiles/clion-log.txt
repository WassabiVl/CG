CMake Deprecation Warning at external/glfw-3.1.1/CMakeLists.txt:8 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0042 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.


CMake Warning (dev) at /home/wvl/Downloads/clion-2018.2.5/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.12/Modules/FindOpenGL.cmake:270 (message):
  Policy CMP0072 is not set: FindOpenGL prefers GLVND by default when
  available.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0072" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  FindOpenGL found both a legacy GL library:

    OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib64/libGL.so

  and GLVND libraries for OpenGL and GLX:

    OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib64/libOpenGL.so
    OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY: /usr/lib64/libGLX.so

  OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE has not been set to "GLVND" or "LEGACY", so for
  compatibility with CMake 3.10 and below the legacy GL library will be used.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  external/glfw-3.1.1/CMakeLists.txt:88 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
